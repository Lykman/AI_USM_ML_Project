# AI USM ML Project
### About the Project
This repository contains a machine learning project for AI USM, showcasing Mediapipe and OpenCV-based hand-tracking capabilities. Developed and maintained by [Lykman](https://github.com/Lykman).
### Key Features
- Hand tracking using Mediapipe
- Drawing application integrated with OpenCV
- Interactive color selection and canvas clearing
### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `ai_usm_mL_project.ipynb` notebook.
## Potential Applications
This project is not only a creative tool but also has potential for educational and therapeutic use:

### For Children:
- **Interactive Learning**: Helps children develop motor skills and creativity through an engaging and interactive drawing experience.
- **Gamification**: Can be adapted for educational games where children learn colors, shapes, and hand-eye coordination.
- **Fun and Engagement**: Encourages children to interact with technology in a playful yet educational way.

### For People with Motor Disabilities:
- **Rehabilitation**: Can be used in therapy sessions to improve fine motor skills and hand coordination.
- **Accessible Art**: Allows users with limited physical mobility to express themselves through drawing using simple hand gestures.
- **Therapeutic Exercises**: Supports guided hand exercises to assist in recovery from injuries or conditions affecting the motor system.

### General Use:
- **Creativity Tool**: A fun and innovative way for anyone to explore digital art using gestures.
- **Prototyping**: Useful for experimenting with gesture-based interfaces in other applications, such as augmented reality or robotics.
